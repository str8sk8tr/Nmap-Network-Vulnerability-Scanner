# Nmap-Network-Vulnerability-Scanner
Project: Krampus

### Overview
Nmap allows network admins to find which devices are running on their network, discover open ports and services, and detect common known vulnerabilities.

### How it works
Using Kali Linux, ran a host discovery scan to recognize all the devices connected to my network.

### Process

Step 1: Nmap Installation

Nmap is pre-installed in almost every Linux distribution. But in case itâ€™s missing, you can install it manually by usingt he following command. 
  ### apt-get install nmap

Step 2: Ran Scripts
